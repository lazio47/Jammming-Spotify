# Jammming-Spotify

In this project I used a rapidapi spotify api instead of the oficial spotify api.

## Steps:
1. Insert your rapidapi spotify api access key
2. Search
3. Add tracks and a name for the playlist
4. In this case the playlist is not updated to a user spotify account, instead we have a list in the bottom of the page with all of the playlists.

## The search results will not have elements that are in the actual playlistTracks
